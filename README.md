# Python-Earthquake-Project
Project that automates the downloading of earthquake csv files with simple calculations.

In this project, I made the program download a csv file from earthquake.usgs.gov that contained every earthquake recorded in the past week. The main idea for this was to have a project where I just extracted the location, magnitude, and time of each earthquake.

I would like to add more features such as using the pandas library(which I am currently learning) in order to have better visualization of the data. There are many other things to add, but for now I just want the scope to be manageable.
